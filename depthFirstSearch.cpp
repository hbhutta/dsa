    - Note that DFS and BFS will depend on how the graph is implemented
    - They will also work on trees because trees are also graphs 
        - Remember that trees are acyclic graphs


    1. Start at the root node (or any arbitrary node)
    2. If the node started at has neighbours, go to one of them
        - Each time a node is visited, mark it as such
    3. If the current node is the search target, return true and end
